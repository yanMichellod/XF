/**
 * \defgroup test01 First Test Project
 * \brief    Uses Task01Tm class to test XF.
 *
 * This test lanches an instance of the Task01Tm class and produces some output. Optionally,
 * multiple instances of Task01Tm can be created to test the XF.
 *
 * The Test Factory (TestFactory01) instanciates 2 objects:
 * - An object of Task01Tm which outputs the text \b "Say Hello" every second
 * - An object of Task01Tm which outputs the text \b "Echo" every half second
 *
 * This results into the following output:
 * \image html test01-output.png "Output Received by the TraceLog Application"
 */

/**
 * \defgroup test02 Second Test Project
 * \brief    Uses StateMachine02 class to test XF.
 *
 * This test checks again timeout handling and proper termination of a state
 * machine.
 *
 * This results into the following output:
 * \image html test02-output.png "Output Received by the TraceLog Application"
 */

/**
 * \defgroup test03 Thirth Test Project
 * \brief    Uses StateMachine03 class to test XF.
 *
 * This test checks basic event handling in state machines. In this example
 * the StateMachine03 class sends itself an \a evRestart event to change from
 * one state to an other.
 *
 * This results into the following output:
 * \image html test03-output.png "Output Received by the TraceLog Application"
 */

/**
 * \defgroup test04 Forth Test Project
 * \brief    Uses StateMachine04a and StateMachine04b class to test XF.
 *
 * Tests if timeouts are correctly cancelled. When leaving a state with a transition
 * having a timeout, without the timeout raises, the timeout must be cancelled (unscheduled).
 *
 * This results into the following output:
 * \image html test04-output.png "Output Received by the TraceLog Application"
 *
 */
 
/**
 * \defgroup test05 Fifth Test Project
 * \brief    Uses StateMachine05a and StateMachine05b class to test XF.
 *
 * With this test multiple timeouts are added to the XFTimeoutManager list at the same time.
 * This tests the way how new timeouts are added in relation to other timeouts (with 
 * the same timeout value) already added to the list. For more details how the objects
 * are created, please refere to the implementation of the TestFactory05 class.
 *
 * The expected output should be as follows:
 * \image html test05-output.png "Output Received by the TraceLog Application"
 *
